# window_tiler

This solves a couple of problems I was having:
 - Sometimes I lose windows when I change monitor configuration. They're off somewhere out in the ether. I just want them brought back to where my cursor is.
 - My window positions and sizes are sometimes messed up by any monitor changes I might make, or just by Windows when I log in. I want them remembered so I don't have to keep rearranging them.

I couldn't find anything around that solved these problems reliably with multiple monitors. So I wrote this.

Instructions:
 - CTRL-ALT-G : Gathers all the windows on your desktop to the top corner of the monitor your mouse is currently over.
 - CTRL-ALT-SHIFT-1 -> CTRL-ALT-SHIFT-9 : Saves your desktop window positions and sizes.
 - CTRL-ALT-1 -> CTRL-ALT-9 : Restores your desktop window positions and sizes, that you previously saved.
